            <h1>ROMEO AND JULIET</h1>
            <p>This song was created by Taylor swift, the song is a love novel by romeo and juliet but adapted today.</p>
            <p>Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
                I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
                You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
                It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
            </p>
            <p>So I sneak out to the garden to see you
                We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
                So close your eyes
                Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
            </p>
